	     Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which light passes. It is calibrated in f/stops and is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16. Lower f/stops give more exposure because they represent the larger apertures, while the higher f/stops give less exposure because they represent smaller apertures. This may seem a little contradictory at first but will become clearer as you take pictures at varying f/stops. Be sure to check your manual first to learn how to set Aperture Priority for your camera, then try experimenting to get comfortable with changing the aperture and recognizing the effects different apertures will have on the end-result image.</p> </div></section>

	 <section class="ISO">
                <h2 align="center">ISO</h2>
         The ISO setting is one of three elements used to control exposure; the other two are f/stop and shutter speed. In most cases manually setting the f/stop and shutter speed, or using one of the camera's automatic exposure controls (aperture- or shutter-priority, for example) is all you'll need to do. But when the situation calls for a shallow depth-of-field and, thus, a wide lens opening, and/or a fast shutter speed, that combination may not allow enough light to reach the sensor. Or, in the case of photographing a concert performance, the widest lens opening and slowest hand-holdable shutter speed may not enable enough light to reach the sensor. The solution for both instances: boost the ISO to increase the sensor's sensitivity to light. </p> </div></section>

 <section class="Shutter">
                <h2 align="center">Shutter Speed</h2>
	 	Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes. As one of three elements that affect how light or dark an image is (called exposure), understanding shutter speed is essential to taking full creative control of the camera.A camera takes a photograph by exposing a digital sensor (or a piece of film) to light. The shutter is simply a barrier that keeps light out when you’re not taking a photo. Pressing the button at the top of the camera (it’s actually called the shutter release) opens the shutter, and when the shutter is open, an image is recorded. When the shutter closes, the camera stops recording.

The shutter speed, then, is just how long that barrier stays open to let light into the image. Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes.
